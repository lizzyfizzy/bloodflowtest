# bloodflowtest
The folder assets includes my project with the completed blood flow visualizer.
The game manager script manages the instantiation of the blood objects and controls the desired density or number of blood objects flowing.
The followroute code moves the blood object along the desired curve and allows for customization of speed and the color/width of the drawn path.
The UI allows you to visualize the path before starting the project and change the path in the editor.
